# 8 Javascript Dynamic Elements And Events 
 
##Learning Competencies 

##Summary 

 ## Overview

Understanding how to bind and handle events is a core part of being a web developer. This challenge tasks you to take a reasonably well factored Javascript application and extend it to include event bindings. Some of the good practices you'll see in the provided code are:

1. Using templates from the HTML to add elements.
3. Using functions to scope variables (i.e. todoTemplate is accessible within buildTodo, but *not* in the global scope. [Why?](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions_and_function_scope?redirectlocale=en-US&redirectslug=JavaScript%2FReference%2FFunctions_and_function_scope))
3. Using functions to do only one thing (i.e. building the Todo DOM Element vs
   building the element *and* adding it to the list)

This should provide you with a solid foundation to complete the remaining
features.

### Core
This challenge requires you to manipulate objects that have been added
dynamically. You may want to brush up on [Event
Delegation](http://davidwalsh.name/event-delegate).  

#### Objectives
Download the [todo
skeleton](http://s3.amazonaws.com/dbc_socrates/challenges/js-events.zip) and
modify it so:

1. A todo may be added to the page.
2. A todo may be marked as complete.
3. A todo may be removed from the page.

(Hint: Create named functions and bind them to the appropriate buttons)


### Stretch
When creating lists, you often want to reorder them. Use [HTML5 Drag and
Drop](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/dnd/basics/) events to allow manual
sorting of the todo list.
